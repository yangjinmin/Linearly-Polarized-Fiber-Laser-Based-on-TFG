We have proposed and demonstrated a tunable linearly polarized Yb-doped fiber laser based on a 45° tilted fiber grating and a fiber Bragg grating with a linear cavity design. Using a 45° tilted fiber grating as polarization device, a linearly polarized laser output with a central wavelength of 1065.9 nm, a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.03 nm, and a polarization extinction ratio higher than 35 dB is achieved. The output laser polarization extinction ratio is stable within 4 hours. Based on the temperature characteristics of the fiber Bragg grating’s reflected wavelength, the center wavelength is continuously tunable in the range of 1065.92 nm~1066.87 nm. The polarization extinction ratio of the output laser is maintained at 30 dB or more during wavelength tuning.
