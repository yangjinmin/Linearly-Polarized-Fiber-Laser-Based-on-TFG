The innovation lies in the application of a new type of polarizer.
##  Introduction
Fiber lasers with linearly polarized laser output have important applications in fiber optic gyroscopes, coherent beam combination, supercontinuum generation, and high-order harmonic generation. In order to maintain the all-fiber structure of the laser and reduce the manufacturing cost of the laser, it is a feasible way to add a polarizer in the cavity. Traditional commercial polarizers are complex to manufacture, costly, and have large insertion loss. The 45°TFG (Tilted Fiber Grating) proposed in recent years has a series of outstanding advantages such as high PDL (Polarization Dependent Loss), low insertion loss, compact structure, good heat dissipation performance, and good compatibility with fiber optic devices. It can be used as a Ideal polarizers are widely used in fiber sensing and fiber lasers. This paper builds a linearly polarized fiber laser based on a 45°TFG linear cavity structure.
##  Properties of TFG
The schematic diagram of the 45°TFG structure is shown in Figure 1. A series of fringes with periodic changes in refractive index will be produced during the UV lithography writing process. According to Brewster's law, when unpolarized light enters the interface where the refractive index changes at Brewster's angle, the p light continues to propagate, and the s light radiates out of the fiber through the fiber cladding. In 2009, Mou used the alternative Green's function method to conduct theoretical and experimental research on the coupling mode of light in TFGs with different tilt angles. The results show that when the tilt angle is 45°, the tilted grating has the greatest loss of s light. Therefore, 45°TFG can have a fairly high PDL and can act as a polarizer.
